        <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
        <p>
          The Nonprofit Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring
            assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large
            scale. Technologies with a usage culture in a production environment, low risk and recommended to be
            widely used.</li>
          <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a
            real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL
            technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share
            knowledge and experiences.</li>
          <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us;
            technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS
            technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organization. You will
            find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have
            started a prototyping effort.</li>
          <li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that
            we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects,
            but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Our purpose</h3>
        <p>
          At <a href="https://hikaya.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hikaya</a>, we aim to understand the emerging technologies and tools that could
          benefit NGOs and nonprofit organizations in making informed technology choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project focuses on actively documenting and assessing both current tools and those on the horizon, aiming
          to make sense of the evolving technology landscape to support these organizations.
